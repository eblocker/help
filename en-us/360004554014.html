<h1>No eBlocker icon on setup.eblocker.com</h1>
<p>If you do not see an eBlocker icon in the top right corner of your browser when you visit <a href="http://setup.eblocker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://setup.eblocker.com/</a>, clear your browser cache and visit <a href="http://setup.eblocker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://setup.eblocker.com/</a> again.</p>
<p>How to empty your browser cache is described in our <a href="360000227134.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs</a> in the section "eBlocker - General questions".<br> <br>If you still do not see the eBlocker icon, go to <a href="http://setup.eblocker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://setup.eblocker.com/</a> with another device. If you see the eBlocker icon in the upper right corner of your browser, the display of the eBlocker icon in the eBlocker "Settings &gt; Devices menu" may be disabled for the other device.</p>
<p><strong>Please also note our tips on WLAN repeaters in the eBlocker <a href="360000227134.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs</a> i</strong>n the "eBlocker - Network" section.</p>
<p>Check if your used device (computer) may be on your network via LAN and WLAN. If both modules are activated, your computer may also have two MAC and IP addresses. For example, if you do not need the WLAN because you are already connected to your network with the LAN cable, deactivate the WLAN on your device (computer) once.</p>
<p><strong>Check if your device (computer) uses eBlocker as gateway.</strong></p>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<p>With the onboard tools of macOS you can easily recognize whether the eBlocker is correctly integrated.</p>
<p>Open the search (the magnifying glass in the upper right corner) and type "Network". The search will automatically suggest the text "Network Utility". Press the Enter key. In the window that opens, select "Trace", enter www.eblocker.com in the text field and click on the "Trace" button. The "Trace" command shows you the path through the Internet that you travel to the target server. The first IP address is important. This should be the IP address of your eBlocker.</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p>You can also easily recognize whether the eBlocker is correctly integrated.</p>
<p>Open the command line program (CMD). Now enter the command "tracert www.eblocker.com" and wait briefly until the request is finished. The "tracert" command shows you the path through the Internet that you travel to the target server. The first IP address is important. This should be the IP address of your eBlocker.</p>
