<h1>Problems with apps</h1>
<p>Apps can establish HTTPS connections to reach specific services. If you use the SSL function on the eBlocker and have stored the eBlocker certificate on your device, some apps may not be able to establish a certain connection to a server because the eBlocker prevents the app from doing so.</p>
<p>First check the eBlocker "Settings &gt; Menu HTTPS &gt; "Trusted Apps" tab to see if there is already an exception for your app. If so, please activate it and restart the app.</p>
<p>There are two ways to find the blocked connections.</p>
<p>Either you see already in the „HTTPS“ menu of the eBlocker in the tab „communication failures“ that a connection was blocked, or you can use the „Manual Recording“ function of the eBlocker, which you can find this in the eBlocker Settings &gt; „HTTPS“ menu &gt; Tab „Manual Recording“.</p>
<p>Instructions for the „Manual Recording“ function can be found here: <a href="360004553714.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBlocker Manual Recording</a></p>
<p>If an App still has problems contacting a server even if the exception rule is activated, please test if the „Domain“ blockers will help in this case. Proceed as follows in this case:</p>
<p>In the eBlocker Settings &gt; menu „Devices“ &gt; set the Blocker to „Automatic“ in the tab „Blocker“ and deactivate the HTTPS function for this device in the tab „HTTPS“.</p>
