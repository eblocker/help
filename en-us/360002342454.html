<h1>Release Notes 1.0</h1>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">New Features</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Parental Control <em>(Family Edition only)</em></strong></p>
<p>You can now define a set of Parental Control profiles to control and restrict internet access of certain devices, e.g. your kid’s tablets, laptops or game consoles. Per profile, you can activate predefined website categories (black lists) with (literally) millions of known websites, which provide unsuitable or malicious content. And you can define daily time slots, when internet access should at all be possible.<br> The Parental Control black lists will be updated automatically on a daily basis (if automatic updates are enabled).</p>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker can now connect your local network with OpenVPN networks to anonymize your outgoing IP address. This is an alternative to <em>Tor</em>. You can even define multiple VPN profiles and use different VPNs for different devices. <br> We tested the connection to several commercial VPN providers (<a href="https://www.eblocker.com/en/vpn_provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.eblocker.com/en/vpn_provider</a>). </p>
<p><strong><em>Tor</em></strong></p>
<p>The stability and usability of the <em>Tor</em> function was improved significantly. You can always test the actual <em>Tor</em> status and your current exit node via the eBlocker controlbar.<br> If <em>Tor</em> should temporarily become unavailable, you will no longer bypass <em>Tor</em> unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>Device Management</strong></p>
<p>The eBlocker itself and the internet/Wifi router are now also shown in the list of all device. They are easily recognizable by their unique icons.<br> Furthermore, the device list indicates if a device is currently online.</p>
<p><strong>DHCP Server (Manual Network Mode)</strong></p>
<p>There are several new features, when the eBlocker is operated in manual network mode, e.g., when the eBlocker takes over the role as DHCP server for the local network:<br> For each device, you can decide if it should receive a fixed IP address.</p>
<p>Existing devices will keep the IP address previously assigned by the internet/Wifi router when the eBlocker’s DHCP server is switched on.</p>
<p><strong>SSL</strong></p>
<p>When activating the SSL function for the first time, or when renewing the eBlocker’s SSL root certificate, it is now possible to provide a unique name for the certificate. This way, the certificate can easily be recognized and identified.</p>
<p>The SSL exemption list offers now a search field for the domain to make it easier to find domains and maintain the list.</p>
<p><strong>Setup and Support</strong></p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the automatic setup of the eBlocker device does not work and the eBlocker Console is not reachable in the local network, it is now possible to insert an empty USB thumb drive into the eBlocker. When rebooting, the eBlocker will automatically write log and diagnostic messages to this thumb drive to help resolving the issue.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Bug Fixes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 / Edge Support</strong></p>
<p>The eBlocker icon and controlbar are now also available on Windows 10 with the Edge browser. Please note that the advanced pause feature (adding 5 minute intervals and aborting pause) is not yet available with the Edge browser.</p>
<p><strong>Android Devices</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, it can happen that Android devices show Wifi reconnection messages, because the eBlocker blocks certain hidden communication to Google or others. This feature was further improved to avoid these reconnection messages.</p>
<p><strong>Ad-Blocker</strong></p>
<p>A bug was fixed that in some cases prevented the update of the ad blocker filter definitions.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>More than 20 additional bugs were fixed to further improve performance and stability.</p>
