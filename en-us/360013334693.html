<h1>How to keep a VPN connection alive?</h1>
<p>When using VPN connections, some providers disconnect inactive connections after too short a period of idle time.</p>
<p class="ng-scope" translate="HELP_ICON.ANON.VPN_KEEP_ALIVE.OVERVIEW.P2">This may go unnoticed by the eBlocker, if the connection is not actively monitored. If you encounter connection problems, you can enable active monitoring:</p>
<p>In the eBlocker menu just check "IP-Anonymization" &gt; "VPN Network" and open the details of your main VPN connection by clicking on the correct table row.</p>
<p>At "Active monitoring of VPN connection" you can choose one of the following options:</p>
<p><strong>Disabled</strong> (standard) - there will be no additional efford to keep up the VPN connection, if your VPN provider offers a bi-directional keep-alive monitoring of the VPN connection, an additional active monitoring is not necessary</p>
<p><strong>Regularly ping VPN provider</strong> - there will be a minimal amount of traffic directed to your VPN provider in order to maintain the connection</p>
<p><strong>Regularly ping eBlocker</strong> - your eBlocker will send a minimal amount of traffic to our domain www.eblocker.com so your eBlocker will be able to maintain the VPN connection</p>
<p><strong>Regularly ping custom host</strong> - you can enter a domain or IP adress where the eBlocker shall send some minimal network traffic to maintain the connection</p>
