<h1>No Internet, but the eBlocker can still be accessed</h1>
<p>In rare cases there might be no connection to the Internet. The reason for this could be a crash of an essential eBlocker subroutine, or a wrong setting in the eBlocker DNS function.</p>
<p>In such case, check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can your router be reached to the browser with its IP address?</li>
<li>Can you access the eBlocker settings in the browser when you enter the IP address of the eBlocker (for past eBlockerOS versions please enter the eBlocker IP address and type in :3000 (example: 192.168.1.240:3000)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer is “yes” for both questions, please go to the eBlocker settings &gt; menu "System" &gt; tab "Reboot and Shutdown" and reboot the eBlocker ( "Reboot" button).</p>
<p>Your eBlocker will shut down first and then reboot. The process takes approximately five minutes. After the reboot you should be able to use the Internet as usual.</p>
<p>If the process does not lead to the desired success, please go to the eBlocker Settings &gt; Menu "IP Anonymization" &gt; Tab "DNS".</p>
<p>Please check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the eBlocker DNS feature activated?</li>
<li>Do you use the settings "Custom list of external DNS servers" and have only specified one DNS server (for example your router)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer is “yes” for both questions, please change the eBlocker DNS as follows:</p>
<p>Select the "Default" option which uses the DNS server in your network.<br>Optionally click "Custom list of external DNS servers" and enter more than one DNS server.</p>
<p>You can find a list of DNS servers for example <a href="https://www.eblocker.com/en/dns-server-liste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If this starts to happen more often, please contact the eBlocker support team and send the eBlocker diagnostic report. You can find it in the eBlocker Settings &gt; Menu "System" &gt; Tab "Diagnostic Report". The report will be saved in your download folder or in the folder you specify.</p>
