<h3>Workaround for FritzBox 7490 issues</h3>
<p>eBlocker now uses IP masquerading in manual network configuration. This ensures that SSL, FTP and other non-HTTP connections are more reliable when eBlocker is connected to a Fritzbox 7490.</p>
<h3>Network configuration is verified</h3>
<p>Input on the network configuration screen is now validated more thorougly.</p>
<h3>Registration can be reset</h3>
<p>The registration can be reset when eBlocker was registered with a wrong license key. Use this feature only if advised by support. This action can not be undone and you can not re-register the previous license key.</p>
<p>Note that the following reboot will take up to 5 minutes.</p>
<h3>Improved tracker blocking</h3>
<p>An issue was fixed where links from Google were sometimes leading to white pages.</p>
<h3>UI improvements</h3>
<p>The controlbar rendering was improved for Microsoft Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers.</p>
