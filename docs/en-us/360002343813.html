<h1>Release Notes 1.9</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>eBlocker OS 1.9</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">New Features</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Malware Protection</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker now protects your devices from malware and phishing on webpages. The corresponding malware filter lists will be updated daily. With this new feature eBlocker warns you when you click a malicious link or access a malicious webpage. However, no protection method can provide 100% security and you still need Anti-Virus Apps protecting your local device. In addition, we highly recommend not to click on any suspicious links or open emails from unknown sources.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate renewal for SSL / HTTPS</strong></p>
<p>To protect HTTPS connections, you might have enabled SSL and added eBlocker’s security certificate to your devices. Each security certificate has an expiration date and needs to be renewed after expiration. Initially eBlocker used a 1 year validity for certificates. These certificates are now about to expire for our very early users. For most users the certificate validity is 3 years now. To facilitate the renewal of the eBlocker certificate your eBlocker will now automatically generate a new certificate and use it, once the previous certificate has expired. In the parallel eBlocker will notify you on each device that the new certificate needs to be added to the device again. Please make sure to add the new certificate to each device in order to protect HTTPS-connections.</p>
<p><strong>Device settings restructured</strong></p>
<p>The device settings page has been restructured to improve the usability: Now all features for device configuration are organized in tabs. You find individual tabs for general settings, anonymization settings and message related settings.</p>
<p>And the devices page loads faster now, especially when there are many devices in your local network.</p>
<p><strong>System Messages</strong></p>
<p>System messages are now classified as “important” or merely “informational”. On the devices page on the new tab “Messaging” (see above), you can choose per device, whether you want to see all, only important or no messages at all on that device.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker’s Dashboard is now linked from the ControlBar and offers additional information about your eBlocker. It now shows the SSL status of the current device and all system messages that are relevant for the current device. More dashboard functions will be added in future.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files and Diagnostics Report</strong></p>
<p>Obsolete and misleading messages have been removed from the log files. Important information regarding DNS and other topics have been added to the diagnostics report. The relevant log files are now automatically added to the diagnostics report to make it simpler to gather all necessary information when contacting support. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Bug Fixes &amp; Improvements</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Security Bug</strong></p>
<p>A bug in the eBlocker VPN-Settings allowed access to the eBlocker by uploading malicious data, even without knowing the administrator password. To make use of this bug, it was necessary to have access to the eBlocker device from within the local network. This bug has been fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<p>Under heavy network traffic the network driver sometimes caused spontaneous restarts of the eBlocker. This bug has been fixed.<br> In very rare cases a bug stopped certain sub processes. The eBlocker had to be rebooted to work around the bug. This bug has been fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Parental Control: Improvements Notification for Blocked Webpages</strong></p>
<p>When using eBlocker’s parental control eBlocker now displays a detailed notification why a certain webpage was blocked, also when eBlocker DNS (beta) is active. In the previous release, only an unspecific browser error page was shown, when the parental control feature was used together with DNS.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Additional bugs have been fixed and further improvements to the UI and the core processes have been implemented to increase the performance and stability.</p>
<p><em>Please note that an update to the current eBlockeOS version 1.9.x may take up to 10 minutes. <br>Please clear your browser cache after the update.</em></p>
