<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p>Support for Tor has been added. Note that due to missing SSL support, only unencrypted HTTP traffic can be routed via Tor.</p>
<p>For diagnosing routing problems, a packet logging feature has been added. Packet logging can be enabled in the System settings screen.</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker does not send ICMP redirect packets any more. These redirects could possibly confuse clients by telling them to send outgoing packets directly to the router instead of the eBlocker.</p>
<p>When enabling the manual network configuration, eBlocker's built-in DHCP server is now started reliably after the next boot.</p>
