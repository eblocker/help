<h1>The eBlocker and switches</h1>
<p>In a home network there are mainly three types of switches: "Unmanaged Switch", "Web Smart Switch" and "Managed Switch".</p>
<p>The eBlocker usually works without problems with so-called "Unmanaged Switches". With so-called "Web Smart Switches", or "Managed Switches", network problems can occur with eBlocker due to the complex network configurations for unexperienced users.</p>
<p>We recommend an "Unmanaged Switch" if you want to expand your home network with a switch.</p>
<p><strong>Unmanaged Switch</strong></p>
<p>For smaller networks.<br>All devices connected to the switch receive their IP addresses from the router's DHCP server.<br>Do not provide an administration interface and therefore cannot be configured.</p>
<p><strong>Web Smart Switch</strong></p>
<p>For medium and large networks.<br>Gets an IP address from the router's DHCP server.<br>Offers a web-based administration interface and can therefore be configured.<br>Offers additional configuration options for the devices connected to the switch (usually DHCP server, VLAN, LACP and QoS)<br>Has less configuration options than a "Managed Switch".</p>
<p><strong>Managed Switch</strong></p>
<p>For large networks.<br>Gets an IP address from the router's DHCP server.<br>Provides an administration interface and can therefore be configured.<br>Offers extensive configuration options for the devices connected to the switch.</p>
