<h1>I have a new router and cannot reach the eBlocker anymore.</h1>
<p>If you replace the old router with a new router, you may not be able to reach the eBlocker even though the network LEDs on the eBlocker are lit or flashing.</p>
<p>One reason could be that your eBlocker's DHCP server is enabled. This collides with the also active DHCP server of your new router.</p>
<p>In this case we recommend resetting the eBlocker to its factory settings. <br>We have described <a href="360004553934.html">here</a> how this works.</p>
