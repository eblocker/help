<p>Do not connect the eBlocker inbetween the router and your hardware firewall. The eBlocker will recognize the hardware firewall as an active device and display it as visible to the eBlocker.</p>
<p>Connect the eBlocker to a free Ethernet port of the hardware firewall. Most hardware firewalls provide a DHCP server in the network settings. If the eBlocker is not compatible with the hardware firewall in automatic network mode (Plug &amp; Play), then you can put the eBlocker in its individual network settings. After setting, the eBlocker will take over the DHCP server. We recommend deactivating the DHCP server in the network settings of the hardware firewall.</p>
<p>If you don’t need a DHCP server in your network, you can put the eBlocker in his individual network settings and disable the DHCP server of the eBlocker. You will see the IP address of the hardware firewall as the gateway in the network settings of the eBlocker. For the network settings of the devices, we recommend inserting the IP address of the eBlocker as the gateway. If a device is not protected by the eBlocker, you must enter the IP address of the hardware firewall as the gateway.</p>
