<h1>Is the eBlocker legal?</h1>
<p>Yes. Everyone has the right to opt-out of user profile collection. In the United States “privacy” is defined as the “right to be left alone” which implies the right to opt-out. In Europe and Germany the privacy laws state the right to opt-out of any user profiling action. So it’s your right to automatically opt-out of data collection by using the eBlocker.</p>
