<h1>Is it possible to assign a fixed IP address to the eBlocker?</h1>
<p>Yes, most routers offer this function in the network settings.</p>
<p>For a Netgear router, the settings can be found here:<br>Netgear "Advanced View" &gt; Configuration &gt; LAN Configuration &gt; select/edit the eBlocker.</p>
<p>A Fritzbox-Router from AVM offers the settings here:<br>Fritzbox "Home Network" &gt; "Home Network Overview" &gt; "Network Settings" &gt; click on the pen to the right of the desired device &gt; check the box "Always assign the same IPv4 address to this network device".</p>
<p><strong>This is what you should do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the settings of your eBlocker</li>
<li>Now open the settings of your router in a new browser window and change the IP address of the eBlocker<br>Go back to the eBlocker settings and go to the "System" menu</li>
<li>Reboot your eBlocker (in the "Reboot and Shutdown" tab)</li>
<li>The reboot takes about five minutes</li>
<li>When you open setup.eblocker.com in your browser, you will see the eBlocker Dashboard.</li>
<li>You can see the new eBlocker IP address on the "Settings" card.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disconnect all active devices from the network once or restart them. This is necessary for these devices to receive the new IP address from the eBlocker.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong><br>If you select a different IP address for the eBlocker, this must be in the IP address range of your DHCP server! Therefore, only change the last of the four number blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 192.168.1.xxx</p>
<p>If you also change the other three number blocks, the eBlocker is no longer accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know...?</strong></p>
<p>If you switch the eBlocker to individual network mode in the Settings &gt; Network menu, the eBlocker takes over the DHCP server in your network and treats all IP addresses found as fixed addresses.</p>
<p>You can then decide yourself whether a device should keep the fixed IP address or whether the DHCP server of the eBlocker should assign an IP address from the DHCP range to this device.</p>
