<h1>Important requirements</h1>
<p>You should get an IPv4 connection from your Internet provider. eBlocker Mobile does not work with an IPv6 connection.</p>
<p>In your network's router, to which the eBlocker is connected to, a configure port needs to be forwarded from port 1194 (protocol UDP) to the eBlocker's IP address.</p>
<p>In order to have a fixed DNS name for the eBlocker-Mobile function, DynDNS could optionally be very helpful.</p>
<p>If you have several routers and your eBlocker is connected to the second router, you have to forward port 1194 from the first to the second router and then forward port 1194 from the second router to the eBlocker.</p>
<p>If you own a router that does not allow port forwarding than you cannot use the eBlocker Mobile function.</p>
<p>The eBlocker DNS Firewall function should be enabled.</p>
