<h1>Contact eBlocker Support</h1>
<p>Most technical questions are answered in our <a href="360000227134.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs</a>.</p>
<p>If you still could not solve your problem, our support will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>If you have access to the eBlocker settings, please send us the eBlocker diagnostic report with your support request. You can find the diagnostic report in the eBlocker "Settings &gt; Menu &gt; System &gt; "Diagnostic Report" tab. Creating the diagnostic report takes a few seconds. The eBlocker then saves the diagnostic report as a file with the extension .TGZ on your computer.</p>
<p>If you cannot reach the eBlocker settings via the normal way, please try the emergency IP address of the eBlocker. http://169.254.94.109:3000/</p>
<p><strong>Please give our support some more information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Which eBlocker do you own (Base / Pro / Family)?</li>
<li>Which router do you use?</li>
<li>Are there other network devices (e.g. switches, dLAN, WLAN repeaters, access points) between eBlocker and the end devices? If so, which ones?</li>
<li>Is the eBlocker directly connected to your router?</li>
<li>Does the yellow and green LED on the eBlocker port for the orange network cable light up?</li>
<li>Does your router recognize the eBlocker? (In the router, you will usually be provided with a list of all devices e.g. under menu items such as Home Network)</li>
<li>Which operating system do you use?</li>
<li>Which browsers do you use and do you actively use extensions for your browsers?</li>
</ul>
