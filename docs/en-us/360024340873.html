<h1>How did it come to insolvency?</h1>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">eBlocker is a start-up company that needs financial resources to build its business until its planned profitability in 2021. In February 2019, the conclusion of a major financing round failed because the main investor dropped out unexpectedly at short notice. This threatened the company with insolvency and the filing for insolvency was necessary due to legal requirements.</p>
