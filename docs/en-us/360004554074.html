<h1>The eBlocker and the Fritzbox 7490</h1>
<p>The Firztbox 7490 is still not compatible with the eBlocker in Plug &amp; Play mode, because it has a confirmed bug, which is expressed by the extremely slow speed when the eBlocker is connected.</p>
<p>The bug is not eBlocker specific, but results from the non-standard routing of the Fritzbox 7490, if the WLAN of the Fritzbox is used.</p>
<p>The problem can be solved by changing the eBlocker to its individual settings and then deactivating the DHCP server of the Fritzbox 7490.</p>
<p>In the individual settings eBlocker starts its own DHCP server. With this setting the Fritzbox 7490 is also compatible with the eBlocker.<br>On the following website we show the steps of the conversion: https://www.eblocker.com/de/individuelle-einstellungen/</p>
<p>Alternatively you can deactivate the WLAN of the Fritzbox and leave the DHCP server of the Fritzbox activated. Then you can connect a FritzRepeater (e.g. 1750E) to the Fritzbox via LAN.</p>
<p>The FritzRepeater will then offer the WLAN as an access point (LAN bridge). In this combination the eBlocker should also be Plug &amp; Play compatible with the Fritzbox 7490.</p>
