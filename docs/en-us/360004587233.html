<h1>eBlocker DNS Firewall</h1>
<p>If you enable this feature, you can use your eBlocker to distribute DNS requests to a list of different DNS servers, or to have them resolved over the Tor network. There are three different options available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default</li>
<li>Tor Network</li>
<li>Custom list of external DNS Srvers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../attachments/360004587233-dns-en.png" alt="dns-en.png"></p>
<p><strong>Default</strong></p>
<p>The setting of your local network is used here. The DNS server entered in your router is used.</p>
<p><strong>Tor Network<br></strong></p>
<p>The DNS requests are routed through the Tor network and passed to a DNS server at the starting point of the Tor network.</p>
<p>This feature can slow down Internet access a little. This is also true for devices that are otherwise not routed through the Tor network.</p>
<p><strong>Custom list of external DNS servers<br></strong></p>
<p>With this option you can store a list of DNS servers. This list can then be processed by the eBlocker in order of availability or in random order.<br>We have listed a small number of DNS servers for you here <a href="https://www.eblocker.com/en/dns-server-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.eblocker.com/en/dns-server-list/</a></p>
<p>You can find other publicly available DNS servers on the Internet. Enter the terms "Public name servers" or "Alternative DNS servers" in the search engine.</p>
