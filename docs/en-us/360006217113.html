<h1>How do I know if the eBlocker certificate is stored correctly?</h1>
<p><strong>For eBlocker Pro and eBlocker Family customers.</strong></p>
<p>Open setup.eblocker.com in your browser to display the eBlocker Dashboard. Alternatively, you can go to the eblocker.box page to access the dashboard.</p>
<p>On the dashboard you will find an HTTPS card. This shows whether the eBlocker certificate has been stored correctly. The verification may take a few seconds. If both points on the card are green, the eBlocker has identified the HTTPS certificate.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="../attachments/360006217113-dashboard-https-en.png" alt="dashboard-https-en.png"></p>
<p>After a successful verification, you should see the eBlocker icon in the upper right corner of your browser on an HTTPS web page.</p>
<p>If the HTTPS card is not on the dashboard, check the upper right corner of the dashboard and activate the HTTPS card.</p>
<p><strong>For eBlocker Base customers.</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker Base can only display the eBlocker icon on HTTP pages.<br>All features of your eBlocker Base are still active; only the icon is missing.</p>
