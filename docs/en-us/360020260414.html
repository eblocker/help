<h1> Router restarts spontaneously</h1>
<p>In very rare cases the router may restart after a few hours if you connected the eBlocker to the router.</p>
<p>This behavior is currently only known from the Fritzbox 6490 Cable.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the eBlocker scans the network for new devices every 10 seconds. This problem can be solved by switching to a 5 minute search for new devices.</p>
<p>Please go to the eBlocker Settings &gt; Menu "Devices". At the top you will see a tab "Device Discovery". Please click on the tab and change the search for new devices to 5 minutes.</p>
