<h1>Release Notes 2.3</h1>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">eBlockerOS 2.3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parental Control</strong></p>
<p>eBlocker's Parental Controls functions have been completely renewed. All settings regarding the users, the assigned devices and the protection rules for children can now be made on one single page. It is no longer necessary to jump back and forth between several pages.</p>
<p>There are also new cards in the parent dashboard. Parents now have a separate card for each child on their dashboard to see the most important parameters. They can even block the child's Internet access immediately or allow 10 minutes of additional Internet time. For all other settings parents can jump directly from the dashboard to the settings page for each child.</p>
<p>The dashboard for children has also been revised: Children will now only see those cards that are useful for them.</p>
<p><strong>eBlocker Status</strong></p>
<p>Another new dashboard card allows you to disable or enable the eBlocker for the current device. In addition, the most important eBlocker functions can be tested directly using this card. In the event of an error, the card provides troubleshooting tips.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>The dashboard has been further improved. Dashboard cards can now be collapsed and unfolded to improve the overview and handling. On small screens (smartphones), all cards are initially collapsed and only one card can be expended at a time.</p>
<p>Many other small improvements and optimizations makes working with the dashboard now much easier and more intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified activation</strong></p>
<p>The eBlocker can now easily be activated (or deactivated) for individual devices directly in the device overview. It is no longer necessary to open the detail view for each device first.</p>
<p>The same mechanism applies to trusted apps. The HTTPS exception lists for trusted apps can now also be activated and deactivated directly in the trusted apps overview list.</p>
<p><strong>Malware protection</strong></p>
<p>The malware blocker now also works as a pure domain blocker and is therefore available with optimal performance even if HTTPS support is not activated.</p>
<p><strong>Further improvements</strong></p>
<p><strong>IP anonymization</strong></p>
<p>Display of VPN status in settings and dashboard now updates faster and shows correctly if the VPN connection is established or not.</p>
<p>If the eBlocker is deactivated for a device, a VPN connection is of course no longer active. The changed state is now visible in the dashboard and in the controlbar.</p>
<p>The eBlocker supports now also multiline entries in the "connection" field of an OpenVPN configuration file.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>
<p>Drag &amp; drop of cards works now better on small screens.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Report</strong></p>
<p>Additional important data and log files have been added to the diagnostic report.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>The processing of the domain filter lists was further optimized.</p>
<p>The internal processes have been further optimized to accelerate the start of the eBlocker and to avoid unnecessary system calls during configuration changes.</p>
<p>User guidance and help texts have been further improved.</p>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<p>In rare cases, an unauthorized person in the internal network could switch off the automatic checks for updates. This bug has been fixed: Only the owner of the administration password (if one is set) can disable the update check.</p>
<p>After reverting to factory settings, the history of DHCP leases was not always deleted. This bug has been fixed. The complete history of DHCP leases is now always removed, when the eBlocker is reverted to factory settings.</p>
<p>In rare cases an unexpected error message could occur if a very long URL was blocked, e.g. by the tracker blocker. This bug has been fixed. Even oversized URLs do not cause an error message anymore, if they are blocked.</p>
<p>Some misleading and unnecessary error messages and warnings have been removed from the log files and from the user interface.</p>
