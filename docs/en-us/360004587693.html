<h1>The eBlocker and WLAN Repeater</h1>
<p>Many WLAN repeaters work with a so-called WLAN bridge mode. In this mode, other devices can connect to the network via the WLAN repeater.<br> <br>For the router and thus also for the eBlocker, each device connected via the repeater can usually be seen with the hardware address (MAC address) of the repeater. This means that the eBlocker cannot distinguish between devices connected via a repeater. We are working on making the eBlocker more flexible at this point.</p>
<p>Instead of a WLAN repeater you could use an access point. An access point, also called LAN bridge, is connected directly to your router with a LAN cable and provides a WLAN signal. Access Points usually transfer the IP and MAC addresses of the devices to your network and are therefore compatible with the eBlocker.</p>
