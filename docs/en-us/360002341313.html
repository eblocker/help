<div class="modalBlock bottom-nav">
<p>Restoring the factory settings (Factory Reset) or inserting a new SD card with the eBlockerOS also deletes the activation for automatic updates.</p>
<p>In this case, you can reset your old eBlocker license and then reactivate your eBlocker with this license.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the following website: <a href="https://www.eblocker.com/en/license-transfer/">https://www.eblocker.com/en/license-transfer/</a>
</li>
<li>Enter the e-mail address with which you have activated the eBlocker license and answer the security code request.</li>
<li>After a few seconds you will receive a mail from our license server (check the SPAM folder if necessary).</li>
<li>In the mail, click on the link "View account details and transfer license".</li>
<li>On the web page that opens please, click on the link "Release License" near the applicable license and confirm the license cancellation.</li>
<li>You will then receive a confirmation that the license has been successfully removed from the device and your license key will be displayed.</li>
<li>Copy the license key or make a note of the license key if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the eBlocker settings you can reactivate the license key by clicking on the button "Activate new license".</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong></p>
<p>The mail address must be the same, because the license key is connected to the mail address.</p>
<p>After activating the license, you may have to renew the eBlocker HTTPS (SSL) certificate and store it on all devices. </p>
