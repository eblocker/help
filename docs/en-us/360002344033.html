<h1>WiFi repeater and the eBlocker</h1>
<div class="article-content">
<p>WiFi repeaters are often used to improve signal strength and range in homes and small offices. Many WiFi repeaters work with a so-called bridge mode. In this mode, other devices can log on to the network via the WiFi repeater. For the router, and thereby also for the eBlocker, however, each device connected via the repeater can usually be seen with the hardware address (MAC address) of the repeater. This means that the eBlocker cannot identify the devices connected via a repeater. </p>
<p>Starting with eBlockerOS version 1.14.8 the eBlocker can now handle devices much better, which are connected via a Wifi repeater. It is however important that these devices have once logged into the router's Wifi directly, so that the eBlocker can unambiguously identify the MAC and IP address of the device.</p>
