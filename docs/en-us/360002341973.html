<p>If an IP address will not be anonymized by the eBlocker, this may have several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The eBlocker is not activated for the device.</li>
<li>The eBlocker is enabled for the device, but the eBlocker HTTPS function was not enabled for the device and (or) the eBlocker certificate was not properly stored on the device.</li>
<li>You were using neither the Tor network nor a VPN server connection. The IP address cannot be anonymized.</li>
<li>Parts of the website may come from the browser cache.</li>
<li>You are using a browser extension which could reveal the true IP address (for example FLASH).</li>
<li>You may have activated the IPv6 protocol for your internal network (home network), which is not yet compatible with the eBlocker.</li>
