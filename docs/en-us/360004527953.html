<h1>I bought the eBlocker second hand.</h1>
<p>If the seller contacted you before the purchase, you should be able to set up your eBlocker normally.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, we need some information from you so that we can reassign the eBlocker license for you.</p>
<p>Write us an email to support@eblocker.com and tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first three blocks of the license key.</li>
<li>The serial number of your eBlocker (located at the bottom of the eBlocker).</li>
<li>The email address with which you want to activate your eBlocker license key.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will contact you as soon as we have the license setup.</p>
<p>After that you should reset the eBlocker to its factory settings once.</p>
<p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty file named "eblocker-factory-reset.txt" on the USB stick.</li>
<li>Disconnect the eBlocker from the power supply.</li>
<li>Connect the USB stick to the lower USB port of the eBlocker.</li>
<li>Connect the eBlocker to the power supply.</li>
<li>The factory settings are now restored. After approx. 5 minutes the eBlocker will switch off again (no LED activity).</li>
<li>Remove the USB stick.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now connect your eBlocker to your router and connect the eBlocker to the power supply. Starting the eBlocker takes approximately 5 minutes.<br>Then go to the setup.eblocker.com page in a browser and click on the eBlocker icon at the top right of this page.<br>The Controlbar opens and you can run the Activation Wizard.</p>
