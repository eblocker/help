<h1>I want to sell my eBlocker.</h1>
<p>If you want to resell the eBlocker, we recommend the following steps before shipping:</p>
<p>1. Restore the eBlocker's factory settings.</p>
<p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty file named "eblocker-factory-reset.txt" on the USB stick.</li>
<li>Disconnect the eBlocker from the power supply.</li>
<li>Connect the USB stick to the lower USB port of the eBlocker.</li>
<li>Connect the eBlocker to the power supply.</li>
<li>The factory settings will now be restored. After approx. 5 minutes the eBlocker should turn off again (no LED activity).</li>
<li>Remove the USB stick.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Write us an email to support@eblocker.com:</p>
<p>We need the following information from you to reassign the license key in our license database:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first three blocks of the license key.</li>
<li>The serial number of your eBlocker (located at the bottom of the eBlocker).</li>
<li>Your email address with which you activated the eBlocker license.</li>
<li>The email address of the new owner, so that they can activate the eBlocker with the license key.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will contact you as soon as we have changed the license.</p>
