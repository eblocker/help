<h1>Tips for the eBlocker Dashboard </h1>
<p>The eBlocker Dashboard is the control center for your device and your eBlocker. Here you can view all important information and make changes.</p>
<p>Gradually we will make more and more so-called cards available in the dashboard and thus greatly expand the range of functions. You will also be able to do more complex configurations of eBlocker for your device via the dashboard.</p>
<p>You can open the dashboard with the URL eblocker.box or via the website setup.eblocker.com.Â  You can also enter the IP address of your eBlocker and write /dashboard behind it ( example: 192.168.10.210/dashboard ).</p>
