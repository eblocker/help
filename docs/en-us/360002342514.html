<h1>The eBlocker and IP address ranges</h1>
<p>The eBlocker can only work within one of the three so-called private IP address ranges. These three IP address ranges are intended for private use in local networks.</p>
<p>The three IP address ranges are:</p>
<p>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255<br>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255<br>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</p>
<p><em>(Source Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network)</a></em></p>
<p>This means that the eBlocker can operate for example in the IP address range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254, but not in a network that either hosts several IP address ranges, or whose IP address range is outside one of the three IP address ranges listed above.</p>
