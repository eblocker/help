<h1>How does the eBlocker offer more protection than other tools?</h1>
<p>Traditional tools focus only on a small, specific area for individual devices. For example there are specific browser plugins for PCs that block trackers only, and others that just block online ads. Even with several browser plugins activated at once, it is very likely that the visited website will still track you by your IP-address. However, the eBlocker blocks all user profiling services and lets you surf anonymously, hiding your IP-address. With just one click you can enable the Tor network which prevents your IP-address from being identified. A comprehensive privacy protection is only possible in this combination.</p>
