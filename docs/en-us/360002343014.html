<p>The Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490 contains a confirmed bug, which makes itself visible through extremely slow speed as soon as the eBlocker is connected.</p>
<p>The bug is not eBlocker specific, but results from the non-standard routing when using the WLAN of this router.</p>
<p>Other Fritzboxes are not affected. The manufacturer (AVM) is aware of this bug.</p>
<p>You own a Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490 and want to use the eBlocker, but don't want to reconfigure your Fritzbox and the eBlocker? There are two solutions to this situation then:</p>
<p><strong>1. Do not use WLAN</strong></p>
<p>Hardly anyone would want to do without WLAN, but if you deactivate WLAN in the Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490, the eBlocker will work in Plug &amp; Play mode without any problems with your Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490.</p>
<p><strong>2. Deactivate WLAN and integrate a WLAN Access Point</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the most elegant solutions for the Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490 customers. You deactivate WLAN on the Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490 and integrate a WLAN Access Point into your network. The WLAN Access Point is connected to your router via LAN cable and then builds up a WLAN network.</p>
<p>Known FritzWLAN Repeaters with a LAN port are FritzWLAN Repeaters DVB-C / 1750E / 450E. You connect them to the Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490 and then operate the FritzWLAN Repeater as a LAN Bridge (Access Point).</p>
<p>Instead of a FritzWLAN Repeater you can also connect a Router compatible with the eBlocker as Access Point. It is important that the second router does not own a DHCP Server, as this is already provided by the Fritzbox 3272 / 3490 / 7360 / 7490.</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> The Fritzbox Repeater function is not a WLAN Access Point! </p>
