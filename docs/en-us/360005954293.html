<h1> Where can I find the eBlocker's IP address?</h1>
<p>The most easy way to find the IP address of your eBlocker is on the dashboard, which you can open in your browser either with setup.eblocker.com, or eblocker.com.</p>
<p>You will find the IP address of your eBlocker on the "Settings" card behind "eBlocker:".</p>

<p>You can see the connected devices in your router settings. The eBlocker should be listed as "eblocker" in this list of connected devices.</p>
<p><strong>Windows / macOS / Linux</strong><br>In a terminal (Command Line / CMD), you can find all IP addresses in your network with the command "arp -a". The displayed addresses and information may look different depending on the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Android / iOS</strong><br>On mobile devices you can scan your network with apps like " he.net Network Tools ".</p>
